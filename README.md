# Earnings Surprises Analysis
This project replicates the Ball and Brown (1968) study to examine the relationship between earnings announcements and stock returns using SAS. It also analyzes analyst forecast accuracy and earnings surprises for U.S. firms.

### Context  
This project was completed as part of the **ACCT 626: Data Analytics in Accounting** course at the Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University (Winter 2025).

### Project Structure
code/: Contains SAS scripts for:
- Earnings surprise calculation
- Market reaction analysis (Post-Earnings Announcement Drift - PEAD)
- Analyst forecast accuracy evaluation
  
figures/: Visualizations of cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) and earnings surprise distributions.

data/: Data sources (Compustat, CRSP, and IBES) used in the analysis (not included due to access restrictions).

### Results include:

Market reaction to earnings announcements from 1971–2017.
Analyst forecast accuracy for 2022–2024.

### Key Findings
Market Reaction: Stocks with positive earnings surprises show upward CAR trends, while negative surprises result in declines, confirming the PEAD phenomenon.
Forecast Accuracy: Analyst forecasts generally align with actual earnings but display slight overestimation tendencies.
